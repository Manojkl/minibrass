MiniBrass is a project rooted in research on self-organizing, adaptive systems conducted at the [Insitute of Software and Systems Engineering](http://www.isse.de) at the [University of Augsburg](http://www.uni-augsburg.de/), Germany. 

We used the tool to solve multiple problems typically occurring in a university such as *scheduling exam dates*, *assigning students to industry mentors*, or *assign term papers*. Currently, we are extending our focus to more application areas.

## Contributors  

MiniBrass is mainly developed by [Alexander Schiendorfer](http://www.isse.uni-augsburg.de/staff/schiendorfer/), as part of his PhD research.
