% This one offers only one hardware slot, cannot work at all 
% First simplistic data
maxSoftwareSlots = 2;
maxHardwareSlots = 1;

maxHwIdent = 3; % Temperature, Pressure, Light Temperature
maxSwIdent = 2; % Logger, Database

maxCapabilities = 2; % temperature and pressure 
capabilities = [{1}, {2}, {1}];
payload = [20, 20, 15];

% Current configuration
hardwareAtSlot = [1]; % first slot holds (heavy) temp sensor, second is empty
softwareAtSlot = [1, 0]; % first slot holds logger, second not installed

% Task spec:
requiredCapabilities = {1,2}; % temperature, pressure
payloadThreshold = 40;

% Constraint relationships (changing software 1 and 2 is more severe than changing hardware 1)
crEdges = [| 1, 3 | 2, 3 |];

% Expected output -----------------
% This model+data will return "=====UNSATISFIABLE====="
% as there can be *no* solution due to the lack of slots
