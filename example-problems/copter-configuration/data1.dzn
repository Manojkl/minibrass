% First simplistic data
maxSoftwareSlots = 2;
maxHardwareSlots = 2;

maxHwIdent = 3; % Temperature, Pressure, Light Temperature
maxSwIdent = 2; % Logger, Database

maxCapabilities = 2; % temperature and pressure 
capabilities = [{1}, {2}, {1}];
payload = [20, 20, 15];

% Current configuration
hardwareAtSlot = [1, 0]; % first slot holds (heavy) temp sensor, second is empty
softwareAtSlot = [1, 0]; % first slot holds logger, second not installed

% Task spec:
requiredCapabilities = {1,2}; % temperature, pressure
payloadThreshold = 40;

% Constraint relationships (changing hardware 1 is *more severe* than changing hardware 2)
% Changing hardware is always more severe than changing software 
crEdges = [| 1, 4 | 2, 4 | 1, 3 | 1, 4 | 4, 3 |];

% Expected output -----------------
% This model+data will return 
/*
  Software (current): 
    s[1]: 1
    s[2]: 0
  Hardware (current) 
    h[1]: 1
    h[2]: 0
  -----------  
  Software (target): 
    s[1]: 1
    s[2]: 0
  Hardware (target) 
    h[1]: 1
    h[2]: 2
which means that sensor 2 is installed at slot 2,
since the joint payload is 20+20 <= 40 and less transitions
are better
