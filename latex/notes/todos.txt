How to replace p-norm by general ordering?
CP nets: What cannot (easily) be expressed?

To Do
----
Include "CR into Weighted" as a counter-example for optima simulation

Plan
----
Why partiality?  Why do weight not suffice?
- Distributed setting
- Different specifiers, even when not distributed
- Not comparable, even when total orderings (weights)
Why modularity?
- 
Why heterogeneity?
- Different specifiers, different formalism
- Unifying framework

What's not in?
